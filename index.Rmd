# Introduction

European Honeybees, *Apis mellifera*, are highly efficient pollinators of crops and wild flowers and hence provide exceptionally important economical and ecosystem services for us humans [@kearns1998; @gallai2009]. *A. m.* has many subspecies and to better understand this species as a whole it is crucial to collect knowledge about their origin and taxonomic differences as well as their local distributions [@ruttner1988; @phylogen2020]. Sadly, even though we learn more each day about the importance of insects in our ecosystems an alarming decline of wild pollinators can be seen over the last years [@hallmann2017; @s√°nchez-bayo2019]. The reasons for the decline seem manifold: parasites; pathogens; environmental pollution; rapid climate change; loss of insect friendly habitats; etc. [@biesmeijer2006; @potts2010; @goulson2013; @woodcock2017].

In this small paper, which is part of an homework assignment for the course "Mod. Multivariate Biostatistik und geometrische Morphometrie" at the University of Graz I try to apply basic geometric morphometric practices to differentiate possible subpopulations or lineages of *A. m.*. Similar investigations were done before and [@kekecoglu2018; @kandemir2009; @tofilski2008; @francoy2006]. In these studies, as well as in my assignment, the fore- and backwing of *A. m.* are used, as they are easy to dissect and photograph and posse a high degree of variability in wing venation [@grimaldi2005].

The main goal was to get a better understanding for geometric morphometrics and how to apply its methods in various biological questions. With the help of geometric morphometrics we can not only measure morphological similarity or differences but also put the results, in the form of actual shapes, in context [@mitteroecker2009]. Other advantages of geometric morphometrics are that the data can easily be collected from digital images and size differences are mathematical removed with the procusters method to focus purely on shape or with size-and-shape we analyze the form [@mitteroecker2009; @mitteroecker2013]. This would not be possible with traditional morphometrics, which is only an indirect capture of the shape.

# Material and Methods

In total 52 scanned forewing and backwing images were available, of those ten were provided by Dr. Robert Brodschneider, which were collected in 2011 in Graz by a student. Dr. Juergen Herler, University of Vienna, did contribute the other images, which were collected in the year 2009 from colonies in Graz, Frohnleiten and Vienna. No further information on the images were given. Not all images could be used as I only used wings were all landmarks were visible. Also the backwing scans for Graz 2011 had a really poor quality and were dropped for the analysis part.

Landmarks (LM) were set on homologous points either at the end of wing veins or were two or more veins met. This was done with the tps software package [@rohlf2015] and the set landmarks can be seen in figure \@ref(fig:landmarkImage). Analysis was performed in R with the RStudio IDE and tidyverse [@r2020; @RStudio2021; @tidyverse2019]. Generalized procuster analysis (GPA), which centers the shape on the origin, scales all shape to the unit size of one and tries to minimize least square distance by rotation [@mitteroecker2009], was performed with the @geomorph2021a package. Also the setting of sliding landmarks and thin-plate spline (TPS) deformation grids were done with @geomorph2021a. The resulting aligned procuster coordinates, which represents the shape for each specimen, were exploratory analyzed with principal component analysis (PCA) and also used to extract the point-distance [@raster2020] to calculate the traditional morphometrics cubital index (CI) based on @goetze1959. For the multiple group linear discriminant analysis or canonical variate analysis (CVA) the first ten principal components (PC) were used and the accuracy of classification was tested with leave-one-out cross-validation [@MASS2002].

(ref:landmarkImage) Example of forewing (left) and backwing (right) image, with landmark positions. White colored points with blue numbers represent the appr. location of the sliding landmarks, which define the outline of the wing.

```{r landmarkImage, fig.cap='(ref:landmarkImage)', out.width='40%', fig.show='hold', include=TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/backwing.png")
```

# Results

(ref:csPlot) Boxplot distribution of the centroid size. Comparison between samples forewing and backwing respectively. The backwing is missing for "Graz 2011" due to poor image quality.

```{r csPlot, fig.cap='(ref:csPlot)', out.width='70%', include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/csPlot.pdf")
```

The measure of overall size with centroid size, which is the sum of distances from landmarks to the centroid, shows clear inter-sample difference between all groups for the forewing, see figure \@ref(fig:csPlot) - left. The sample "Graz 2011" shows on average the lowest centroid size. Highest on average, but also with widest standard deviation, is the sample "Frohnleiten 2009". The backwing shows also differences between the groups, sample "Graz 2011" is missing due to poor image quality, see figure \@ref(fig:csPlot) - right. For the backwing the sample "Frohnleiten 2009" has the smallest centroid size on average, compared to the other two groups.

(ref:ciPlot) Boxplot distribution of the traditional forewing cubital index (CI) [@goetze1959]. The CI was calculated by the point distance between LM 15-17 divided by the point distance between LM 17-18, see figure \@ref(fig:landmarkImage).

```{r ciPlot, fig.cap='(ref:ciPlot)', out.width="60%", include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ciPlot.pdf")
```

The comparison of distribution and central tendency of the traditional cubital index (CI) [@goetze1959] is similar between the samples, see figure \@ref(fig:ciPlot). No clear inter-sample differentiation of all groups, with CI alone, is possible.

(ref:pcPlot) Aligned procuster coordinates for all specimens, after GPA. Links (red lines), to better visualize the shape, are connected on the mean coordinates.

```{r pcPlot, fig.cap='(ref:pcPlot)', include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pcPlot.pdf")
```

The LM position after GPA for all specimens can be seen in fig. \@ref(fig:pcPlot). The backwing shows more variation of the aligned procuster coordinates, compared to the forewing.

(ref:fwPCA) Forewing PC1 and PC2 on aligned procuster coordinates and TPS of the extrapolated PC axis difference to the mean reference shape of all specimen.

```{r fwPCA, fig.cap='(ref:fwPCA)', out.width='80%', include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fwPCA.pdf")
```

The PCA for the forewing separates the "Graz 2011" sample from the rest on PC1, see fig. \@ref(fig:fwPCA). The PC1 does already explain over a third of the total variance of all principal components. The first and second combined include over 50% of the total variance, see fig. \@ref(fig:fwPCA). The shape change to the mean reference for PC1 indicates that the sample from "Graz 2011" has a slimmer shape. The PC2 has the same overall shape difference, but vein distances between other landmarks are different.

(ref:bwPCA) Backwing PC1 and PC2 on aligned procuster coordinates and TPS of the extrapolated PC axis difference to the mean reference shape of all specimen.

```{r bwPCA, fig.cap='(ref:bwPCA)', out.width='80%', include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bwPCA.pdf")
```

As for the backwing only the samples from the year 2009 are included and also only a subset thereof, as not all backwings were complete. All groups are overlapping in the first two dimensions, which cumulatively can explain 66% of the total variance, see fig. \@ref(fig:bwPCA). The shape of PC1 differentiates the samples mainly in total vertical volume of the radial cell. Both PC1 and PC2 are predominately defined by the difference in sliding landmarks.

(ref:CVA) Exploratory CVA based on PC 1-10 for forewing and backwing respectively. The percent of captured between-group variance is given on the axes.

```{r CVA, fig.cap='(ref:CVA)', include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cvaPlot.pdf")
```

(ref:densCVA) Kernel density estimate of the samples for the first CVA dimension.

```{r densCVA, fig.cap='(ref:densCVA)', out.width='80%', include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/densPlot.pdf")
```

With the CVA we can improve our differentiation of samples. Most of the between-sample variance is captured by the first dimension in both cases (fig. \@ref(fig:CVA)-\@ref(fig:densCVA)). The accuracy of the CVA classification for the forewing `r round(fwJackExplained, 2)` was better than for the backwing `r round(bwJackExplained, 2)`, see table \@ref(tab:fwCVA) and \@ref(tab:bwCVA), but this may be biased because for the backwing the sample "Graz 2011" is missing.

```{r fwCVA, include=T}
kbl(
  fwConfJack, 
  booktabs = TRUE, row.names = TRUE,
  caption = paste0("CVA leave-one-out cross-validation for the forewing, total accuracity ", round(fwJackExplained, 2), "."),
  )
```

```{r bwCVA, include=T}
kbl(
  bwConfJack, 
  booktabs = TRUE, row.names = TRUE,
  caption = paste0("CVA leave-one-out cross-validation for the backwing, total accuracity ", round(bwJackExplained, 2), "."),
  )
```

# Discussion

The centroid size (CS) is clearly different between our samples, see fig. \@ref(fig:csPlot). The CS in winged insects could be seen as proxy for the actual body size, which was found in a study for damselflies [@outomuro2011]. There are multiple reason why the absolute body size or the wing sizes may differ. One explanation could be genetics and as all worker bees in a colony are sisters the intra-sample variation is lower. Another explanation would be the size of the comb cells which is influenced by the cell size of the foundation made available by the beekeeper and also the age of combs, as in older combs the diameter of cells decreases, due to accumulated cocoons and fecal materials [@berry2001]. It could also be an indicator for environmental conditions, as better nutrient availability probably results in better fed larvae, or function as a visual precursor for underlying health conditions, as Varroosis can lead to deformation of the abdomen or wings [@genersch2010; @morawetz2019].

If we look at the widely used morphometric measurement of the cubital index (CI) [@goetze1959], we can separate our sample into two groups, see fig. \@ref(fig:ciPlot). With "Graz 2011" and "Frohnleiten 2009" having a higher CI on average and "Graz 2009" and "Wien 2009" a lower one. All CI are in range for *A. m. carnica*, based on @ruttner1988. The traditional morphometrics include normally more than one parameter, as in my example [@ruttner2000]. A study on a direct comparison between geometric morphometrics and traditional morphometrics showed only marginally improved results for the geometric morphometrics approach [@tofilski2008]. Nowadays modern genetic methods have shown that traditional morphometrics alone are not always good enough to differentiate subspecies in honeybees [@groeneveld2020].

In the principal component analysis (PCA) each point represent a unique shape of our specimen (shape space). The PCA does only differentiate the sample from "Graz 2011", all other samples are more or less overlapping in the shown PCs for both fore- and backwing, see fig. \@ref(fig:fwPCA)-\@ref(fig:bwPCA). With the extrapolated TPS for the forewing, we see that most of the variance is explained by the height and top outline of the bee wing. As the sample from "Graz 2011" seem to have a more round outline and a thinner shape compared to the other samples. The difference between the first and second PC is not as clear on the first glance, as the overall theme is the same, with slimmer and wider shape, but there is a slight difference in a few LMs, which does express different wing vein length. Some sliding LMs seem to also dominate the difference, the same can be said for the backwing. If the sliding LM differences represent a real shape difference or are only an artifact in our LM settings cannot be said and needs further investigation. Especially the backwing difference along the PC axes seems to be predominately defined by the sliding landmarks of the bee wing outline.

The classification with CVA (fig. \@ref(fig:CVA)), which maximizes the variance between sample means to the pooled variance within the samples, based on the first ten PC dimensions, for fore- and backwing respectively, did have an accuracy of prediction with leave-one-out cross-validation for the forewing of 71% and for the backwing 60%, see table \@ref(tab:fwCVA)-\@ref(tab:bwCVA). The higher accuracy may not only be led back to better differentiation for the forewing per se, with more LM and therefore a higher possibility of variation, but also due to the more distinct "Graz 2011" sample, which already did differentiate based on the first dimension in the PCA.

Even though, I cannot differentiate perfectly between given samples, I have to say that without background information on the collected specimens, it is hard to tell if I even should see a difference, they could also be strongly related colonies in terms of genetic or ecological conditions. It seems so far that geometric morphometrics was only used as tool for differentiation between subspecies, eco-types or populations and no direct effect or cause of the bee wing differences were discussed [@kandemir2009; @tofilski2008; @francoy2006]. The missing discussion and visualization of shape is a great miss in my opinion, as it is one of the great benefits of geometric morphometrics [@mitteroecker2009]. If the goal is only differentiation of populations based on ancestral history modern machine learning approaches on nucleotide polymorphisms seem to be very effective and highly efficient [@momeni2021]. Of course in this case the advantage of geometric morphometrics would be the reduced costs and the accessibility of the needed tools [@francoy2006].
